# sway-themer
Script package to theme the sway window manager, and associated applications.

# Goal
* Provide bash scripts to mange themes for sway, swaylock, waybar, various terminal emulators, maybe gtk
* Allow themes to exist as gzip packages that can be downloaded from other users, websites (security concerns)
* Ask to install programs/fonts/etc. that a theme asks for, but not require installation
* Be bar agnostic (swaybar, waybar, etc.)
* Be termial emulator agnostic (termite, alacritty, etc.)
* Follow similar configuration as i3wm-themer with json files
